       <h1> Community</h1>
At Lupin, we take our Founderâ€™s words to heart. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is not just a mandatory legal provision for compliance. It is a moral and social obligation behind every one of our actions today as it was 25 years ago, when Dr Desh Bandhu Gupta established an autonomous foundation dedicated to rural development.
